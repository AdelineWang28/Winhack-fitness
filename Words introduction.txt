Hello everyone! I’m Zhongli Wang, and today I’m excited to present Winhack-Fitness, a fitness tracking app designed to make staying active easy, interactive, and rewarding!

 Key Features:
1. Profile Management
   - Enter name, age, height, and weight.  
   - Realistic input validation (e.g., age 1-150, height 1-250 cm, weight 1-200 kg).  
   - Invalid inputs trigger error messages for correction.  

2. Exercise Logging
   - Log exercises with name, duration, and calories burned.  
   - Validates inputs (duration > 0, calories non-negative).  
   - Displays workout history in a clean table format.  

3. The Statistics function is mainly used to visualize the user's movement data, help users understand their movement trends, and track calorie consumption


4.Goal Setting
   - Set weekly/monthly calorie burn goals.  
   - Ensures goals are realistic (no negative values).  

The Reward System encourages users to stay motivated by earning medals based on their progress. Users can achieve Bronze at 100%, Silver at 200%, Gold at 300%, and Diamond at 400% of their fitness goals. This gamification approach makes tracking fitness more engaging and rewarding!---

**Winhack-Fitness makes fitness tracking simple and fun for everyone. Thank you!**
